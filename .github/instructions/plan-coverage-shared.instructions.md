# Shared invariant guardrails

These rules apply to Plan Coverage Check and Residual Decision Flow agents when an agent explicitly references this shared instruction. Agent-specific responsibilities, artifact destinations, allowed verdict vocabulary, and stop rules remain in each agent file.

## Required invariants

- **Plan is source of truth**: the parent Plan FR / AC remain the source of truth for implementation, verification, residual decisions, and close readiness. Guardrail artifacts narrow deep-check focus; they do not replace or shrink the parent Plan.
- **No fake-only completion**: source-structure checks, stub tests, fake implementations, mocks, or in-memory substitutes are not enough to claim production behavior is complete. Production implementation binding and production wiring must be verified where the Plan requires runtime behavior.
- **Residual requires explicit decision**: unresolved residual, manual, delegated, deferred, aborted, or human-decision items must be explicitly classified before close. Do not infer acceptance from silence or from weaker evidence than a prior run.
- **Reduce breadth, not depth**: token reduction should remove redundant artifact breadth or repeated boilerplate, not the depth of required guardrail checks for the selected scope.
- **Fail closed on missing authority**: if the required Plan authority, implementation authorization, evidence, or human decision is missing, record the blocker and stop instead of treating the item as complete.

## Shared artifact discipline

- Repository-tracked artifacts are the durable handoff surface. Do not use chat-only notes, temporary files, or tool-local session state as the final source of truth.
- Every handoff should identify the source artifacts read, the current phase, the next required agent or human action, implementation permission, unresolved items, and close readiness.
- When a shared `Handoff Packet` is used, keep common fields stable while leaving agent-specific verdicts and required sections in the agent that owns them.
- Do not drop a parent Plan item because it is outside the current Guardrail Focus. Classify it as implemented, verified, manual, residual, deferred, out of scope by source, or human-decision required.

## Bounded reading

- Read the Plan and upstream artifacts needed for the current phase before reading source code broadly.
- Inspect source files only where the current artifact, selected contract, selected gap, or verification target points.
- Do not continue repository exploration after the current phase has enough evidence to produce its required artifact, verdict, or stop condition.
