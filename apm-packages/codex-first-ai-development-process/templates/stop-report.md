## Why Stopped


## Minimum Human Input Needed


## Not Allowed Until Resolved

- Implementation outside READY scope
- Parent-direct execution of a delegated gate without ParentDirectExecutionException and explicit human approval
- Counting parent-direct work or trivial parent fixes as cost-saving delegation
- Close when DelegationCompliance is FAIL or Agent Usage Ledger is missing
- Close / completion claim
- Secret, external service, billing, or production operation

## Delegation Evidence Needed

- Expected agent:
- Missing observed run:
- Required artifact:
- Required configured model / reasoning evidence:
- Required hook / reported / effective model distinction:
