# Model Tier Mapping Example

This file is an example for maintainers.
Do not treat these labels as fixed model names.

| Tier | Real model | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HIGH_MODEL` | `gpt-5.5` | Use for hard judgment and high-risk planning. Start with high/xhigh reasoning. |
| `STANDARD_MODEL` | `gpt-5.5` | Use for normal implementation and verification. Start with medium reasoning. |
| `CHEAP_MODEL` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | Use for read-heavy scan, docs consistency, and simple local fixes. Start with low reasoning. |

Review this mapping when contracts, available models, pricing, or quality requirements change.
The matching runnable examples live in `profiles/codex-first/agents/*.toml`.
